# Contributing

When showing interest in a PR, or issue, please use the thumbs up/thumbs down emoji on the original message rather than adding comments expressing the same.

Make sure to search for [existing issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue) before creating a new one.

Please create an issue to collect feedback prior to large feature additions. If possible try to keep PRs scoped to one feature.
